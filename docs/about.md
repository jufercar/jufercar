# About Me

## The Journey of a Curious Mind

Since childhood, I've always been curious about how the world works at a microscopic level. While other kids played with more conventional toys, I dreamed of having my own laboratory, filled with test tubes and mysterious flasks. I spent hours mixing ingredients in the kitchen, imagining that I was conducting revolutionary experiments. 

Over time, that passion for science grew and led me to biotechnology, where I discovered a fascinating universe in molecular biology, microbiology, and bioinformatics. Today, I maintain the same enthusiasm as that curious child, but with more sophisticated tools and more complex challenges.
