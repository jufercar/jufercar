# Biotechnology & Bioinformatics — Professional Profile  
Portfolio / CV — Work in progress

## Professional profile
I am a biotechnologist focused on bioinformatics for reproducible analysis of high-throughput biological data. Current work emphasizes scalable pipelines, robust quality control, and statistically rigorous interpretation of omics experiments. I am also focused on data analysis and the development of AI/ML models to study structural biology, including protein structure prediction and structure–function modeling.

## Brief summary
- Specialization in omics data analysis: NGS, transcriptomics, proteomics, and multi-omic integration.  
- Pipeline development for reproducible research, automation, and end-to-end data processing.  
- Technical emphasis on workflow design, quality control, statistical modelling, and application of machine learning to biological datasets.  
- Development of AI/ML models for structural biology and molecular modeling.

## Core technologies & practices
- Languages: Python, R, Bash  
- Workflow engines & reproducibility: Nextflow, Snakemake, Docker, Singularity, Git  
- Typical analyses: read alignment, assembly, annotation, variant calling, differential expression, functional profiling, data visualization

## Current status
- This repository is the landing page for a technical portfolio and CV that are under construction.  
- Notebooks, pipelines, example datasets, benchmarks and documentation will be published here progressively.  
- Contact details and collaboration instructions will be added shortly.

## Note
Technical examples and fully reproducible workflows will be integrated over time. Please check back for updates and published projects.
