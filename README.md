## 👋 About Me

From childhood, I've been fascinated by the microscopic world. While other kids played with typical toys, I dreamed of having my own laboratory filled with test tubes and mysterious flasks. I spent hours mixing ingredients in the kitchen, imagining I was conducting revolutionary experiments. Over time, this passion for science grew and led me to biotechnology, where I discovered a fascinating universe in molecular biology, microbiology, and bioinformatics. Today, I maintain the same enthusiasm as that curious child, but with more sophisticated tools and more complex challenges.
